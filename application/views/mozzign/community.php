        Knitty City is a community so we thought it made sense to help others form their own communities.  Here’s how we do that:    </div>

        There’s a Chinese proverb states that if you give a man a fish, he would eat for a day, but, if you teach him how to fish, he will eat for life.

        <div class="box" style="float: right; margin-right: 0px;">
            <p>So, instead of giving away finished products to charities, we thought we would supply non-profit groups with yarn & needles. We have seen many friendships develop among our customers, and, with that in mind, we sought to develop “Knitting Circles” within non-profits.
            </p>
            <p>For our first project at the New York Asian Women’s Center, we provided yarn & needles for 40 women in  two “safe houses” where they are protected from violence and abuse.  Manufacturers such as Tahki, Stacy Charles and Cascade  Yarn donated yarns. Eileen Fisher donated fabrics for sewing & quilting projects, and our customers gave us their extra “stash” materials.

               Following  is an excerpt from the NYAWC newsletter that illustrates the healing and progress that staff members have reported:

                For the last three months, NYAWC has held knitting projects for the women staying at its shelters. Every Friday night, at two shelters—Rose House and Peace House—women come together for a late-night knitting session. The women enjoy the activity so much that very often the knitting session, planned to meet for one hour, lasts for up to three hours. The knitting sessions provide opportunities for the battered women to de-stress and socialize with their housemates.

                Sometimes they bring their kids. At other times, they bring food to share with each other. NYAWC staff members Hifsa Rajput and Uzma Naz organize the knitting sessions, as well as provide assistance. Yarn and knitting supplies are generously donated by Knitty City.

                Knitty City would  like to continue supporting more circles. If you have any yarn, needles, knitting or crochet materials that you’d like to donate, you can bring them by the store. Thank you for your help!
